1. We will use OpenJDK 11 to build and run these exercises.

2. Recommended IDE is IntelliJ IDEA, but Eclipse 2018-12 or later should also work.

  2.1. For IntelliJ IDEA users, all you should need to do is open the
  masteringthreads.ipr file.  You might need to set up JUnit4 and point your
  IDEA to OpenJDK 11.

  2.2. For Eclipse users, please do the following:
    2.2.1. Open Eclipse
    2.2.2. Go to "File->Import..."
    2.2.3. Select "General->Existing Project into Workspace" and click "Next"
    2.2.4. "Select root directory" should point to this directory
    2.2.5. Click "Finish"
    2.2.6. Ensure that the JDK you are using is OpenJDK 11.
    2.2.7. Import JUnit 4 if necessary.
